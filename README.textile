* Stopping all monit tasks
* Including memcached, thinking_sphinx, and delayed_job cookbooks
* Symlinking facebooker.yml
* Symlinking user_photos

h4. Notes

Recipe written to definitely apply to only a single application.  Will probably need multiples over time.

Copying staging.rb in particular would be more appropriate if it only happened in the staging environment.

The thinking_sphinx configuration should be done in its own recipes.

Building an index on every deploy may not be wanted-- it can become expensive, and might overlap with something in a crontab, possibly.
